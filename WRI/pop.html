                <p>"Animal Farm by Osten" was a very good read, intriguing and interesting too.
                    I am a human being but trust me I was on the animale's side until 
                    the pigs became like humans too. You should absolutely read this one. it is 
                    a promise you won't regret it. There is this super cool theme song in it.
                    "Beasts of England, beasts of Ireland, beasts of every land and clime, harken to
                    my joyful tidings of the golden future time..."
